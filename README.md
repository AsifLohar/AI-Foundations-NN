An artificial neural network uses the human brain as inspiration for creating a complex machine learning system. They can classify millions of sounds, videos, and images, answer our questions, understand our behaviors, and even drive our cars. Neural networks are also the foundation of generative AI.


This course introduces the fundamental techniques and principles of neural networks, common models, and their applications. Instructor Gwendolyn Stripling takes you through the different neural network architectures, their components, appropriate use cases, and best practices for improving neural network model performance.  Plus, gain hands-on experience building and training a neural network using the Keras Sequential API, an open-source library that demystifies the design and training of neural networks. If youâ€™re looking to achieve a solid understanding of how to build, train, improve and use neural networks, join Gwendolyn in this course.


_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"

## Installing
